**Important Notes for a Cheap Budget:**

*   **Travel Dates:** Weekdays (Sunday-Thursday) are significantly cheaper for hotels than weekends. Avoid major holidays or conventions.
*   **Transportation:** Rely on walking, the RTC Deuce bus (good for the Strip), and Downtown Loop (free shuttle in Downtown). Limit rideshares/taxis.
*   **Food:** Look for happy hour deals, food courts, affordable buffets (though these are less common/pricier post-COVID), or even grab items from CVS/Walgreens for some meals.
*   **Resort Fees:** Factor these in! They are almost unavoidable and add $30-$50+ per night to the hotel bill. The prices below are *base rates* and don't include resort fees or taxes.
*   **Flexibility:** Prices fluctuate wildly. The hotel prices are estimates; book well in advance for better rates.
*   **Image URLs:** These are placeholder URLs from common image search results. In a real application, you'd use an image hosting service or API.
